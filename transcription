<h1>RBMS Transcription Guidelines</h1>

In progress -- 20200112, ALT

Option: Record a transcription standard used for the metadata work as a Work related manifestation of work of the transcription standard.
Process 
I integrated the pre-3R RDA text and RBMS PS text to the best of my ability.

Then I cleaned up the formatting and structure the document, retaining internal numbering for ease of navigation and reference to RBMS PS and, if applicable, DCRM(B).

Text that isn’t highlighted is either from the RBMS PS, DCRM(B), or me. Text that is highlighted in yellow was copied and pasted from pre-3R RDA. Text that is highlighted in orange was copied and pasted from post-3R RDA. Text that is highlighted in blue is RBMS PS examples, retained for clarity but with comments omitted; the source of the example was changed from B, G, etc. in the RBMS PS to “[Books]”, “[Graphics]”, etc.. Text that is highlighted in red refers to instructions outside of 1.7-1.12 that needs cross-checking or other follow-up. Text that is underlined and has a comment needs the correct element name or RDA terminology added.
